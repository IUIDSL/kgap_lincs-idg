# L1000 Analysis Tools v1.1


Copyright 2011-2016 Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.

A collection of software tools for working with L1000 data.

## Analysis Tools

A brief description of the tools included in this software package is
given below. The Matlab implementation of the tools is currently the
most mature. Some basic utilities in R and java are also included. We
will update the tools as they become available. Please view the changelog
for changes.

### Matlab Tools: matlab/

#### Requirements

1. Matlab R2014b and above
2. Statistics Toolbox
3. Parallel Processing Toolbox [Optional]

#### Setting the MATLAB path
Run `cd l1ktools/matlab; l1kt_setup` or enter the `pathtool` command, click "Add with Subfolders...", and select the directory `l1ktools/matlab`.

### Running the standard CMap data processing pipeline
All scripts are contained within the `matlab/data_pipeline` folder.
A directory of example .lxb files from a LINCS Joint Project (LJP) plate under the `data/lxb` directory. Note that processing a full 384 well plate can take a long time depending on the machine you're running it on. For test purposes we provide a test plate with a smaller number of samples. We also provide pre-computed results in `matlab/data_pipeline/results` to enable viewing the outputs without running the pipeline and/or to compare their results with CMap's. These outputs are described in the section below. By default all outputs are saved in the current working directory, but this can be overriden using the `plate_path` argument to any of the scripts below.

```matlab
% Setup the envronment
l1kt_setup

% Plate to process
plate_name='TEST_A375_24H_X1_B20'; % A smaller test plate
% Parent folder containing raw lxb files for a given plate
raw_path=fullfile(mortarpath, '../data/lxb');
% Path to map files with sample annotations
map_path=fullfile(mortarpath, '../data/maps');
% Results folder
plate_path=pwd;

% Run the full pipeline on a plate of data
[gex_ds, qnorm_ds, inf_ds, zs_ds_qnorm, zs_ds_inf] = process_plate('plate', plate_name, 'raw_path', raw_path, 'map_path', map_path);

% Run specific parts of the pipeline
% Convert a directory of LXB files (level 1) into gene expression (GEX, level 2) matrix.
% here, using example data
gex_ds = level1_to_level2('plate', plate_name, 'raw_path', raw_path, 'map_path', map_path)

% Convert the GEX matrix (level 2) to quantile normalized (QNORM, level 3) matrices
% in both landmark and inferred (INF) gene spaces.
[qnorm_ds, inf_ds] = level2_to_level3('plate', plate_name, 'plate_path', plate_path)

% Convert the QNORM matrix (level 3) into z-scores (level 4).
% same procedure can be performed using INF matrix (not shown).
zs_ds = level3_to_level4(qnorm_ds, 'plate', plate_name, 'plate_path', plate_path)

```
**Note:** Because the peak detection algorithm is non-deterministic, it's possible that data in levels 2 through 4 could differ slightly for two instances of processing the same plate. The code allows reproducing a previous run by passing a random seed file to the `process_plate` script. We provide such a file at `resources/rndseed.mat`. Reproducing the results provided in `matlab/data_pipeline/results can` be done as follows:

```matlab
% reproduce provided results
[gex_ds, qnorm_ds, inf_ds, zs_ds_qnorm, zs_ds_inf] = process_plate('plate', plate_name, 'raw_path', raw_path, 'map_path', map_path, 'rndseed', 'resources/rndseed.mat');
```

#### Other Tools and Demos (under matlab/demos_and_examples)
* **l1kt_dpeak.m**: Performs peak deconvolution for all analytes in a single LXB file, and outputs a report of the detected peaks.
* **l1kt_plot_peaks.m**: Plots intensity distributions for one or more analytes in an LXB file.
* **l1kt_parse_lxb.m**:	Reads an LXB file and returns the RID and RP1 values.
* **l1kt_liss.m**: Performs Luminex Invariant Set Smoothing on a raw (GEX) input .gct file
* **l1kt_qnorm.m**:	Performs quantile normalization on an input .gct file
* **l1kt_infer.m**:	Infers expression of target genes from expression of landmark genes in an input .gct file

See the documentation included with each script for a details on usage
and input parameters.

#### Demo

type dpeak_demo in the Command Window. This will read a sample LXB
file (A10.lxb), generate a number of intensity distribution plots and create a
text report of the statistics of the detected peaks (A10_pkstats.txt).

* **lxb2txt.sh**: Bash wrapper to lxb2txt.R 
* **io.R**: Classes for reading and writing .gct / .gctx files

#### Demo

### Python Tools: python/

We recently released a major update for reading and writing gct/x files. Key changes include:

    * Underlying data stored in pandas dataframe objects instead of SQLite. This will also enable users to take advantage of pandasâ€™ pre-existing tools for data analysis, including slicing, multi-indexing, plotting, and more.
    * Object oriented class representation of parsed gct/x data, containing data and metadata fields (both separately and as a multi-indexed pandas data frame)
    * Easy to use methods for parsing, writing, and merging both gct and gctx files 
    * Extensive testing (meant to also be contributed to) for more robust documentation of and fixes to edge cases as we/users encounter them

See [the following README](https://github.com/cmap/l1ktools/tree/8b15a689d9d2c2771f8261fd087a466ba5a29f52/python/broadinstitute_cmap/io/GCToo) for instructions on how to set up your Python environment and how to do some basic operations using the GCToo library.

## Common data analysis tasks


### Reading .gct and .gctx files
* **MATLAB**: Use the `parse_gctx` function.
* **R**: Source the script `l1ktools/R/cmap/io.R`. Then use the `parse.gctx` function.
* **Java**: See `ReadGctxExample.java` for an example.

### Creating .gct and .gctx files
* **MATLAB**: Use the `mkgct` and `mkgctx` functions.
* **R** Source the script `l1ktools/R/cmap/io.R`. Then use the `write.gctx` or `write.gct` functions.

### Z-Scoring a data set
* **MATLAB**: Use the `robust_zscore` function. Also see the `example_methods.m` script.

### Reading / converting .lxb files
* **MATLAB**: To read an .lxb into the MATLAB workspace, use the `l1kt_parse_lxb` function.
* **R**: To convert an .lxb file to text, use the `R/cmap/lxb2txt.sh` script.
